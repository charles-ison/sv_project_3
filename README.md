### Running The Program
* Project was compiled and tested using VisualStudio on the machines in the Kelly computer lab  
* To change the photo that is used for each answer, update the file path in the learnply.cpp keyboard() (images are stored in the data/images/... folder)
* To run part 1.a.1 use the 'a' button (displays chosen image as input to the IBFV algorithm)
* To run part 1.a.2 use the 'b' button (displays chosen image as input to the IBFV algorithm and uses the vector field)
* To run part 1.c. use the 'c' button (extracts edges from the chosen image using the Sobel filter)
* To run part 1.d. use the 'd' button (extracts edges from the chosen image using the Sobel filter and uses the vector field)
* To run part 2.a. use the 'e' button (extracts all singularities from the vector field, the key to match the color and type is below)
* To run part 2.b. there are two ways to select a point, first either "shift" + "click" on a quad and a forward and backward streamline will be generated or "ctrl" + "click" on a vertex and a forward and backward streamline will be generated
* To run part 3.a. use the 'f' button (extracts all singularities from the vector field on top of the IBFV vizualization of the same field)
* To run part 3.b. use the 'g' button (extracts all singularities from the vector field on top a streamline vizualization)
* To run part 3.c. use the 'h' button (extracts all singularities and separatrices from the vector field on top of a streamline visualization)

### Singularity Color Key
* Red is a source
* Blue is a sink
* Green is a saddle
* Light Blue is a center
* Yellow is a focus
